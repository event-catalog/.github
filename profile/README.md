## Why EventCatalog?

Event-driven architectures (EDAs) are powerful—but they quickly become **complex and hard to govern**.  
As domains, services, and messages grow, so does the challenge of **understanding, documenting, and communicating** what’s happening across the system.

Without proper documentation, an EDA can become a black box, leaving teams struggling to keep up.
