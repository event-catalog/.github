### Why EventCatalog?

Event-driven architectures share a common challenge: their complexity can quickly escalate as more domains, services, and messages are added.

As business requirements evolve and teams adapt, governing and understanding this distributed architecture becomes increasingly difficult. What begins as a straightforward system often transforms into a complex structure with minimal documentation and discoverability, leaving most people struggling to comprehend it ([I share my thoughts on EDA complexity in this GOTO EDA Day 2024 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=knTL9MABy-ubmdcs&v=VLUvfIm9wnQ&feature=youtu.be)).

[In January 2022 EventCatalog v1 launched](https://www.boyney.io/blog/2022-01-11-introducing-eventcatalog) to help bring discoverability and documentation to event-driven architectures. Between 2022 to 2024, EventCatalog has seen over 13,000 catalogs created, attracted 45 contributors, grown a community of more than 600 members on Discord and was added to [Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-gb/radar/tools/eventcatalog).

EventCatalog is helping organisations around the world bring governance and documentation to their event-driven architectures.

EventCatalog is open source, and you can get [started in minutes](https://eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/getting-started/installation).
